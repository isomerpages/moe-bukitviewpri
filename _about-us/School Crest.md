### SCHOOL CREST

<img style="width:20%;height:50%" src="/images/Homepage/Favicon.png">

The logo, incorporating the initials of the school 'BVPS', symbolises a child with outstretched hands reaching for excellence.

  

The circle symbolises a well-rounded education and emphasises the aim of the school in providing an all-round development - moral, intellectual, physical, aesthetics, social and emotional - for its pupils.

  

**Sky Blue** depicts ultimate success in achieving desired goals.

  

**Navy Blue** shows a happy balance in all aspects of education.

  

White represents virtue and integrity.
