Bukit View Primary School was established in Bukit Batok New Town in January 1986 and started operations in the premises of Bukit View Secondary School. On 24 March 1986, Bukit View Primary School moved into its own building at Bukit Batok Street 21, where it is presently located. The school was officially opened on 31 August 1988.

Since its establishment in 1986, Bukit View Primary School has continuously upgraded its facilities to provide a conducive environment to support teaching and learning. In 2001, Bukit View Primary School completed the PRIME upgrading and has since been operating as a single-session school. The major improvements included a new classroom block, improved administrative and staff rooms, a larger library and canteen, additional computer and science labs and better-equipped special rooms.

Bukit View Primary School has steadily built up its school programming to provide students with a well-rounded education. In 2007, Bukit View Primary School was awarded the Programme for School-Based Excellence Award for its aesthetics programme. The programme then evolved to become the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Nurturing Values and Character through Aesthetics in 2014. The LLP provides all students with a broad-based arts programme, with a talent development component to groom those with the potential to excel. The school was recognized as the Centre of Excellence for Aesthetics in the West Zone for its quality programmes and good practices since 2011.

In the area of teaching and learning, Bukit View Primary School was selected as one of the five prototype schools in 2009 to experiment innovative pedagogies for engaged learning. The school adopted drama as a pedagogy to promote confidence, critical thinking, cooperation and curiosity in students. In 2016, leveraging the strengths from the outcomes of the experimentation, Bukit View Primary School was accorded the Applied Learning Programme in Developing Thinkers, Collaborators and Communicators, with the aim of equipping students with 21st-century competencies.
