<p>As part of its commitment to nurturing future-ready learners, the Ministry
of Education had announced that all students in Singapore schools will
be supported in their learning by the Singapore Student Learning Space
(SLS), an online learning platform that contains curriculum-aligned resources
and learning tools.</p>
<p>With the SLS, students will be able to learn better through the use of
technology.&nbsp; Students will be able to learn anytime, anywhere, and
at their own pace, whether independently or with their peers. Teachers
will also be able to use the SLS to complement their classroom teaching,
further enriching studentsâ€™ learning experience.
