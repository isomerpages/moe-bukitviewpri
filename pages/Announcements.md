We are pleased to share with you that MOE will be setting up an MOE Kindergarten (MK) within Bukit View Primary School in 2028. This is 1 year after we move to Bukit Batok West in 2027, where we will be enjoying new facilities such as Indoor Sports Hall, Performing Arts Studio, Field and Band Room. The MK at Bukit View Primary School will enrol Kindergarten 1 (K1) children from January 2028.
