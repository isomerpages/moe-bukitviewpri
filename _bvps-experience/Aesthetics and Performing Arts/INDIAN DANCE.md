Indian Dance in BVPS serves as a platform for students to appreciate the fine aesthetics of dance. Students are exposed to different genres of dance, including classical, contemporary and fusion. 

  

Students also get to broaden their knowledge in both the theoretical and cultural aspects of Indian dance, thus developing a sense of deep rootedness and love for the art form. 

  

Our dancers develop strong friendships and bond as they learn from one another. They also learn to overcome challenges through strong team spirit and being resilient.
