<p>Indian Dance in BVPS serves as a platform for students to appreciate the fine aesthetics of dance. Students are exposed to different genres of dance, including classical, contemporary and fusion.&nbsp;</p><p>Students also get to broaden their knowledge in both the theoretical and cultural aspects of Indian dance, thus developing a sense of deep rootedness and love for the art form.&nbsp;</p><p>Our dancers develop strong friendships and bond as they learn from one another. They also learn to overcome challenges through strong team spirit and being resilient.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/BVPS%20Experience/Co%20Curricular%20Activities/Aesthetics%20and%20Performing%20Arts/INDIAN%20DANCE/I1.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/BVPS%20Experience/Co%20Curricular%20Activities/Aesthetics%20and%20Performing%20Arts/INDIAN%20DANCE/I2.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/BVPS%20Experience/Co%20Curricular%20Activities/Aesthetics%20and%20Performing%20Arts/INDIAN%20DANCE/I3.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/BVPS%20Experience/Co%20Curricular%20Activities/Aesthetics%20and%20Performing%20Arts/INDIAN%20DANCE/I4.jpg"></div><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>DAY</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>TIME</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>TEACHERS IN-CHARGE</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>VENUE</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>THU</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2 p.m. to 4 p.m.</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Nageswari<br>D/O Olaganathan (I/C)<br><br>Mdm Nur Liyanna Bnte Maznin<br></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Dance Studio</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
