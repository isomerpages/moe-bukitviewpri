<p>In Chinese Dance, we seek to instill in our members the passion for dance, while developing their self-confidence, perseverance and teamwork. We also provide opportunities for our members to experience various dance genres through different performances.</p><p>We have consistently achieved stellar results in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF).&nbsp; Other than performing for the school during the BVPS Annual Prize Presentations and Chinese New Year Celebrations, our dancers have had many external performances and gained confidence in themselves through the experiences.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/BVPS%20Experience/Co%20Curricular%20Activities/Aesthetics%20and%20Performing%20Arts/CHINESE%20DANCE/C1.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/BVPS%20Experience/Co%20Curricular%20Activities/Aesthetics%20and%20Performing%20Arts/CHINESE%20DANCE/C2.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/BVPS%20Experience/Co%20Curricular%20Activities/Aesthetics%20and%20Performing%20Arts/CHINESE%20DANCE/C3.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/BVPS%20Experience/Co%20Curricular%20Activities/Aesthetics%20and%20Performing%20Arts/CHINESE%20DANCE/C4.jpg"></div><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>DAY</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>TIME</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>TEACHERS IN-CHARGE</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>VENUE</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>TUES</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2 p.m. to 4 p.m.</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Tan See Hwa (I/C)<br>Mdm Ng Siew Hong Mdm Eileen Chua Ee Wen<br>Miss Rachel Chew Hui Yi<br></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Dance Studio</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
