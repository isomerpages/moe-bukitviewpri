In Bukit View Choir, members are given opportunities to build their stage confidence and leadership qualities. Our members have performed in annual school events such as National Day celebration and International Friendship Day. We also collaborated with Bukit View Secondary School for combined school choir performances. 

  

In 2019, our choir had the honour of performing at The Chijmes as part of Voices of Singapore. To encourage students to be caring citizens, members performed at Seniors Café and brought joy to the senior citizens visiting the café.
