Malay Dance CCA believes that every member has the potential to develop their talent and build perseverance. We provide opportunities for every dancer to showcase their talents, develop leadership skills as well as to work in teams.&nbsp;

  

The team continued synergy and commitment in giving the best to their performances was rewarded with consistent “Certificates of Distinction” in their Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (SYF) from 2006 till present. In addition, the team has performed in various school and public performances such as the BVPS Annual Prize Presentation and Bukit Batok National Day Dinner.
