In the Angklung and Kulintang Ensemble, members appreciate and experience the joy of making music in every performance. The Ensemble has participated in every Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Central Judging and Arts Presentation since 2010 .

They have been invited to perform at various places such as the Esplanade, Asian Civilisation Museum and National Archives of Singapore. Through these invaluable opportunities, our members have demonstrated perseverance and are ever enthusiastic to share their passion with other schoolmates and the community.
