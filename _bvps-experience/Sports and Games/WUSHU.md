<p>Wushu helps students to develop strength and flexibility through the learning of different stances and routines. Students&nbsp; learn martial arts involving sword and dagger showmanship. Once students familiarise themselves with the complete routines, they will have the opportunity to participate in the National School Games. Besides instilling sportsmanship, students will also be more disciplined and resilient through regular training sessions.</p><p>Students are also involved actively in performances both in school and beyond school , which provide platforms for students to showcase their hard work and talent and instil in them a sense of pride.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/BVPS%20Experience/Co%20Curricular%20Activities/Sports%20&amp;%20Games/WUSHU/W1.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/BVPS%20Experience/Co%20Curricular%20Activities/Sports%20&amp;%20Games/WUSHU/W2.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/BVPS%20Experience/Co%20Curricular%20Activities/Sports%20&amp;%20Games/WUSHU/W3.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/BVPS%20Experience/Co%20Curricular%20Activities/Sports%20&amp;%20Games/WUSHU/W4.jpg"></div><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>DAY</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>TIME</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>TEACHERS IN CHARGE</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>VENUE</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>TUES</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2 p.m. to 4 p.m.</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Tan Shuen Keat Elvin (I/C)<br>Mrs Florence Liew<br>Mdm Kir Soo Kien<br>Mdm Hazel Neo</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Courtyard &amp; (outside Tinker room)</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>THU</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>SCHOOL TEAM<br><u>2 p.m. to 4 p.m.</u></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Tan Shuen Keat Elvin (I/C)<br>Mrs Florence Liew<br>Mdm Kir Soo Kien<br>Mdm Hazel Neo<br></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Courtyard &amp; (outside Tinker room)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
