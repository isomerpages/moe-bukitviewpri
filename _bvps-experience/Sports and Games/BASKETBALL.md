Basketball is the latest sport CCA to be introduced in BVPS. It is a unique CCA that comprises both young girls and boys with a strong passion to pick up one of Singapore’s most participated sport.  Apart from acquiring and mastering skills and knowledge of the sport, our young players develop resilience, practise self-discipline and demonstrate teamwork during the training sessions, as well as competitions.  
  
Together with a team of committed teachers and an experienced coach, we believe in not just imparting a greater understanding of the sport but also to guide students to becoming good sportsmen and supportive team members.
