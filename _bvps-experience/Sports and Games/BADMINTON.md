In Bukit View Primary School, many boys and girls are excited to join the schoolâ€™s Badminton Club annually.

  

As members of the Badminton CCA , students not only learn the basics of the sport through their coaches in a fun and engaging way, but they also gain confidence and develop resilience. Upon mastery of the sport, there are opportunities for students to showcase their skills competitively, thus pushing their limits and demonstrating excellent sportsmanship.
