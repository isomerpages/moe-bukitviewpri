Multimedia Club supports the development of students’ computational thinking. It also provides them with perspectives to solve problems through the use of various coding devices and multimedia platforms. 

  

Throughout the year, students will be given various innovative projects that enhance their logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Through these, students are empowered with lifelong skills such as a sense of responsibility, perseverance and leadership skills.
