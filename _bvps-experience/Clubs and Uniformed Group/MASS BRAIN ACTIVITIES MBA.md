In Mass Brain Activities (MBA) Club, our members explore different board games that develop their thinking and collaborative skills . They also learn to be innovative by revising the games rule or designing new games. Members participate in different competitions such as in Scrabble, Sudoku and Othello. 

  

To widen our community outreach, our members visited nearby preschool and Reach Senior Centre, introduced and taught simple board games to parents and senior citizens respectively. MBA Club builds collaborative skills  and challenges thinking while imparting the values of sharing and caring.
