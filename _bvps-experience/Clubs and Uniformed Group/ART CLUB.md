The Art Club aims to inspire and nurture budding artists  in the school. Students are given opportunities to explore different art forms such as drawing, painting and ceramics, which allows them to express their ideas and creativity while honing their art skills and building their knowledge in visual arts. 

  

The Art Club also provides a platform for students to showcase their talents beyond the curriculum when they take part in various art competitions and presentations.
