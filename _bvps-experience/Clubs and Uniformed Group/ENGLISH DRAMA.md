Bukit View Primary School’s English Drama Club aims to provide students with opportunities for creative expression as well as different platforms to explore and develop their skills and interest in drama. The engaging training programme is designed to develop an appreciation and enjoyment of drama as an art form while building students’ confidence and fostering team camaraderie.

  

Under the guidance of our passionate and dedicated instructor and teachers-in-charge, students hone their skills and talents and they perform for various school events and competitions.
