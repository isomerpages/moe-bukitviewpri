The Befrienders Club hopes to forge close and lasting relationships among the students. Through fun-filled activities and exciting excursions, students make friends and learn how to work with others.

  

Students will learn character values such as Responsibility and Empathy and practise these valuesÂ  when they interact with one another during the activities.
