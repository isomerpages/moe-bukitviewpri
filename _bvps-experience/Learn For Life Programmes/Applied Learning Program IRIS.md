<p>The first component of the Bukit View Learn for Life programme is its
Applied Learning Programme (ALP) ---- Inspiring Reflective and Innovative
Self-directed learner (IRIS). Aligned to the first student outcome of the
school vision, IRIS aims to develop students to be Self-Directed Learners
who have strong foundations, are motivated in learning, and being reflective
and innovative.</p>

<p>This is achieved through the development of BVPS Learning Dispositions:
Adaptability, Reflectiveness and Curiosity, as well as the emerging 21st
Century Competencies, through the BVPS learning experiences, with activities
such as Mass Brain Activities (MBA) and CodeIT! A common set of learning
protocol <strong>Play-Reflect-Ideate-Innovate (PRI2)</strong>, derived from
Kolb’s Experiential Learning cycle and Design Thinking (DT) process, guides
the learning experiences.</p>

<p>MBA uses board games as the main medium for students to go through the
PRI2 process. In this age of technology, offline board games are still
valuable as they offer learning and entertainment beyond screen time. In
the PRI2 process, students apply adaptive thinking through play and deploying
strategies to win. They will also be given opportunities to ideate on modifications
to the games by applying critical and inventive thinking, as they will
continue to refine, improve and innovate on the games.</p>

<p>CodeIT! develops computational thinking in students using different technological
tools. Through the six years in BVPS, students will start with pre-coding
skills and button-based programming, where they play with simple robots
such as the Blue-Bot, and then progress to basic and advanced block-based
and text coding skills through play with robots such as Vex Go, Stick’EM
or Micro:bit and also learn about artificial intelligence. They then innovate
and apply critical, adaptive and inventive thinking when they identify
problems and develop solutions or products. Students will also reflect
on the strategies used and how they can improve on their solutions.</p>

<p>Opportunities are given to all students at Tier 1 to learn the above during
school hours. For students who are more inclined to these areas, they can
be involved in Tier 2 programmes such as the Thinker Week Programmes, CCAs
of MBA Club and Multimedia Club (Coding &amp; Robotics), as well as participation
in external competitions.</p>
