<p>The third component of the Bukit View Learn for Life programme, the GLOW
(Gracious Living in Our World) programme, seeks to</p>
<p>nurture students into active, responsible, and gracious citizens whoare
committed to sustainability. Anchored in the school’s GR<sup>²</sup>IT</p>
<p>values (Graciousness, Responsibility, Respect, Integrity, Tenacity), GLOW
empowers students to find their voice and demonstrate care for the environment.
This aligns with the school’s vision of developing Caring Citizens—individuals
who show empathy, contribute to the community, and actively support Singapore’s
sustainability efforts.</p>

<p>To amplify its green initiatives, Bukit View Primary collaborates with
external partners like the</p>
<p>Southwest CDC for the Green Schools Project and the National Environment
Agency (NEA)</p>
<p>for environmental programmes. Through the school programmes, students
are educated and</p>
<p>empowered to make responsible choices, fostering habits that lead to positive
environmental</p>
<p>change and contribute to building a more sustainable nation.</p>
<p>The GLOW programme is delivered through tiered experiences:</p>

<p><strong>• Tier 1: School-Wide Environmental Awareness</strong>
</p>
<p>All students are introduced to environmental issues</p>
<p>through programmes such as assembly talks, recycling</p>
<p>drives, food waste reduction campaigns, and digital</p>
<p>learning platforms like the Student Learning Space (SLS).</p>
<p><strong>• Tier 2: Environment Champions (ECs) as Influencers</strong>
</p>
<p>ECs play an active role in promoting environmental</p>
<p>sustainability. They participate in school events,</p>
<p>competitions, and lead initiatives such as the ‘Eat Wise,</p>
<p>Waste Less’ campaign. ECs also conduct assembly talks</p>
<p>and other outreach efforts, allowing them to deepen their</p>
<p>understanding of global environmental challenges and</p>
<p>inspire their peers to adopt more sustainable lifestyles.</p>
<p>These experiences help develop their self-leadership and</p>
<p>ability to influence others to reduce carbon footprints.</p>
<p>Through GLOW, we raise environmental awareness and</p>
<p>promote sustainable living, empowering students to take</p>
<p>action for the environment and enhance our green efforts</p>
<p>within and beyond the school. By providing meaningful</p>
<p>learning experiences, we aim to develop students into</p>
<p>caring citizens who understand the impact of their lifestyle choices on
the environment. With</p>
<p>this awareness, students are guided to make responsible decisions that
lead to positive</p>
<p>environmental change. By fostering good habits, we help them see how they
can actively</p>
<p>reduce or offset their carbon footprint, contributing to a more sustainable
Singapore and</p>
<p>achieving the aim of Gracious Living in Our World (GLOW) together.</p>
