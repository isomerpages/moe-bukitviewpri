<p>The third component of the Bukit View Learn for Life programme, the GLOW
(Gracious Living in Our World) programme, seeks to nurture students into
active, responsible, and gracious citizens who are committed to sustainability.
Anchored in the school’s GR<sup>²</sup>IT values (Graciousness, Responsibility,
Respect, Integrity, Tenacity), GLOW empowers students to find their voice
and demonstrate care for the environment. This aligns with the school’s
vision of developing Caring Citizens—individuals who show empathy, contribute
to the community, and actively support Singapore’s sustainability efforts.</p>
<p>To amplify its green initiatives, Bukit View Primary collaborates with
external partners like the Southwest CDC for the Green Schools Project
and the National Environment Agency (NEA) for environmental programmes.
Through the school programmes, students are educated and empowered to make
responsible choices, fostering habits that lead to positive environmental
change and contribute to building a more sustainable nation.</p>

<p><strong>• Tier 2: Environment Champions (ECs) as Influencers</strong>
<br>ECs play an active role in promoting environmental sustainability. They
participate in school events, competitions, and lead initiatives such as
the ‘Eat Wise, Waste Less’ campaign. ECs also conduct assembly talks and
other outreach efforts, allowing them to deepen their understanding of
global environmental challenges and inspire their peers to adopt more sustainable
lifestyles. These experiences help develop their self-leadership and ability
to influence others to reduce carbon footprints.</p>

<p>Through GLOW, we raise environmental awareness and promote sustainable
living, empowering students to take action for the environment and enhance
our green efforts within and beyond the school. By providing meaningful
learning experiences, we aim to develop students into caring citizens who
understand the impact of their lifestyle choices on the environment. With
this awareness, students are guided to make responsible decisions that
lead to positive environmental change. By fostering good habits, we help
them see how they can actively reduce or offset their carbon footprint,
contributing to a more sustainable Singapore and achieving the aim of Gracious
Living in Our World (GLOW) together.</p>
