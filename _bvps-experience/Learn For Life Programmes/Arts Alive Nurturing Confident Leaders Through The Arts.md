in BVPS where students will be provided with authentic experiences to learn
different art forms. For example, students will learn 3 instruments - recorder,
ukulele and keyboard for music, and a range of visual arts medium such
as water-colour, printmaking, batik painting, and ceramics. Beyond the
usual art and music curriculum, BVPS offers an additional dance curriculum
where students learn different dances and techniques such as Jazz dance,
turns, balance, flow. The range of experiences broaden studentsâ€™ cultural
perspectives and develop their confidence in expressions.</p>

students through gaining of values, skills and knowledge in the curriculum.
Following which students will be excited with opportunities to share their
joy of the arts experiences, and finally empowered with exploring applications
of arts in other disciplines such as other subjects, project work and Values
in Action project.</p>
<p>All students will be provided with opportunities to experience the full
Arts Alive! Programme, while those with more interests and talents in the
arts may join the CCAs of Art Club, Chinese Dance, Malay Dance, Indian
Dance, Choir or Angklung Kulintang Ensemble.</p>
