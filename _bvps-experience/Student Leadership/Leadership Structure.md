<p>To align with our school’s vision of developing confident leaders, we
adopt the Emotionally Intelligent Leadership (EIL) model (Shankman et al.,
2015) as the foundation for our student leadership development. Our aim
is to provide all Bukit Viewans with meaningful leadership opportunities
and comprehensive training to nurture essential leadership skills.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 1: Leading Self</strong>
<br>The first step to leadership is to be a leader to self - aware of his/her
abilities, emotions, attitude and mindset. Every Bukit Viewan will form
a positive self-perception and develop self-control through our 6-year
school programmes such as FTGP lessons, GLOW and VIA. They are also given
opportunities to develop and apply their leadership skills through class
committee appointments.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 2: Leading Peers</strong>
<br>Tier 2 Leaders hold appointments and go through trainings specific to
their roles and responsibilities. These student leaders will be empowered
to lead their peers with empathy, effecting positive changes in their respective
domains.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 3: Leading School &amp; Community</strong>
<br>Tier 3 Leaders hold appointments such as Executive Committee (EXCO) or
Senior Prefects in the Prefectorial Board and are given opportunities and
trainings to hone their leadership skills. They will be the agent of change
to lead the School to effect positive change both in school and the community.</p>
