<p><strong><em>Every Bukit Viewan, A Confident Leader</em></strong>
</p>
<p>To align to our school vision on developing confident leaders, we adopt
the Emotional Intelligent Leadership&nbsp;model (Shankman et al, 2015)&nbsp;for
our student leadership development. We aim to provide all Bukit Viewans
with valuable leadership opportunities and comprehensive training programs
to foster their leadership skills.</p>
<p>Recognising the potential in students who exhibit strong leadership qualities,
we are committed to nurturing and developing these talents further through
a structured, 3-tier leadership framework.</p>
<p>This progressive model ensures that every student is given the right support
and guidance at each stage of their leadership journey. The first tier
focuses on identifying and cultivating foundational leadership skills,
while the second tier deepens their understanding and experience through
hands-on roles and responsibilities. Finally, the third tier empowers students
to take on advanced leadership positions, enabling them to apply their
skills and inspire others in the school community.</p>
