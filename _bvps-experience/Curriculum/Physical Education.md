#### **Purpose and Goals of PE at BVPS**


  

The purpose of physical education at Bukit View Primary is to enable students to demonstrate individually and with others the physical skills, practices, and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living.  

In line with MOE PE syllabus, the PE syllabus at BVPS helps students to achieve the six goals of physical education. The six goals are equally important - each interacts with others in a well-planned programme that addresses the knowledge, skills and values desired for every student. Physical education seeks to develop in each student the ability to: 

  

Goal 1: Acquire a range of movement skills to participate in a variety of physical activities. 

  

Goal 2: Understand and apply movement concepts, principles and strategies in a range of physical activities. 

  

Goal 3: Demonstrate safe practices during physical and daily activities with respect to themselves, others and the environment. 

  

Goal 4: Display positive personal and social behaviour across different experiences. 

  

Goal 5: Acquire and maintain health-enhancing fitness through regular participation in physical activities. 

  

Goal 6: Enjoy and value the benefits of living a physically active and healthy life.

  

#### **21st Century Competencies in PE**


  

PE at BVPS provides a natural platform for students to clarify and act on their personal values. It is an authentic setting which allows for social interactions and demonstration of positive emotions as well as social behaviours. Furthermore, the interactive and problem-solving nature of many physical activities means that students have numerous instances to communicate positively with others, source for information, as well as to think critically and creatively – all necessary for 21st century living. Through learning activities and ‘teachable moments’ in physical education, students are given the opportunities to acquire sound moral values, develop social skills and higher order thinking skills, and 21st Century Competencies.

Furthermore, learning experiences and activities are planned into the lessons for students to put values and skills into practice (over an extended period of learning), so as to build good habits of action. Characteristics of strategies include: 

  

• establishing a positive learning environment for all students 

• communicating and relating in a supportive and positive manner 

• modeling of appropriate attitudes, skills, and behaviours 

• allowing students to have a “voice and choice” in what they do 

• establishing clear boundaries and expectations for behaviours 

• structuring appropriate activities to explicitly teach and guide students to make decisions based on a core value system and critical and creative thinking 

• making “teachable moments” explicit and seizing these opportunities when they arise 

• teaching and managing for winning with humility and losing with grace in competitions
