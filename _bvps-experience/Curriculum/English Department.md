#### **Curriculum Framework**&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  


  

The English Language Syllabus 2020 for the Primary level focuses on the development, reinforcement and extension of language skills in the primary years through an enjoyment of the language and the promotion of extensive reading; and leveraging oracy, reading and writing skills to develop knowledge and independent use of the language.  
  
The diagram below presents the key features of the EL Syllabus 2020.

The intent of the ELS 2020 is to develop 21st century skills and emerging competencies in our students and nurture them to be empathetic communicators, discerning readers and creative inquirers.

#### **KEY EL Programmes in BVPS**  

**Speaking @ BVPS**

Oracy lessons are crucial to foster effective communication skills. Through structured activities and discussions, students learn to articulate thoughts, listen actively, and engage in meaningful dialogues. These skills extend beyond classrooms, preparing students for success in diverse real-world scenarios, developing them as empathetic communicators.

  **ACTION! Drama in the Curriculum**&nbsp;

Drama is incorporated into the EL curriculum to teach oracy in BVPS. Students take on the role of different characters and learn critical inventive thinking skills such as articulating their thoughts clearly, looking at situations from different perspectives and formulating decisions. Additionally, their command of the language and social emotional learning are further enhanced through the use of thinking routines.  In our school, we explore various platforms to provide opportunities for our students to hone their drama skills.

#### **News and Views** 
News and Views is one such platform in which our P5 and P6 classes showcase their talents through live drama and video performances. Through these performances, the classes will also be incorporating the learning of values and skills that will help them to be self-directed learners, confident leaders and caring citizens.

#### **ICT in English**  

  

**Moo-O**&nbsp;

  

Moo-O is a participatory electronic story book which provides a fun and engaging software programme that encourages children to read expressively and develop their storytelling skills. &nbsp; Using a webcam, the children will be transported into the virtual story world, where they become the characters they have chosen. Then using a PC microphone, the children can record their voices as they read the story. The final video clip they produce can be easily shared with teachers, classmates, friends and families. &nbsp;&nbsp;

  

**NewsMaker**&nbsp;

  

NewsMaker provides students an easy, affordable and fun platform to practise writing, speaking and presentation skills with the help of interactive digital media. &nbsp; With NewsMaker, students take on the role of news anchor and producer, creating their own story in 3 easy steps: Write! Read! Publish!
