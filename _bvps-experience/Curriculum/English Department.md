## **KEY EL Programmes in BVPS**  

#####  **Speaking @ BVPS**

Oracy lessons are crucial to foster effective communication skills. Through structured activities and discussions, students learn to articulate thoughts, listen actively, and engage in meaningful dialogues. These skills extend beyond classrooms, preparing students for success in diverse real-world scenarios, developing them as empathetic communicators.

  ***ACTION!* Drama in the Curriculum**&nbsp;

Drama is incorporated into the EL curriculum to teach oracy in BVPS. Students take on the role of different characters and learn critical inventive thinking skills such as articulating their thoughts clearly, looking at situations from different perspectives and formulating decisions. Additionally, their command of the language and social emotional learning are further enhanced through the use of thinking routines.  In our school, we explore various platforms to provide opportunities for our students to hone their drama skills.

**News and Views** 

News and Views is one such platform in which our P5 and P6 classes showcase their talents through live drama and video performances. Through these performances, the classes will also be incorporating the learning of values and skills that will help them to be self-directed learners, confident leaders and caring citizens.

**Digital Storytelling**

As part of our ongoing efforts to help our students acquire and develop oral
communication skills; accurate pronunciation, appropriate intonation, read
expressively and speak with confidence, our P1 to P3 students use a novel digital story book platform, Moo-O, that allows them to be the characters of the story they are reading. Students can record a video of them in action and the video clip can be easily shared with their teachers, classmates, friends and families. Not only does this help our students to have an interactive learning experience, they get to have fun reading, acting and performing as well.

##### **Reading @ BVPS** 


In order to instil the love for reading and encourage reading widely, here at Bukit View, we have a range of activities to keep our students engaged. Our reading programme strives to foster a passion for reading by immersing students in captivating literary journeys through diverse text selections which prompts the exploration of worlds and perspectives as a discerning reader. Through interactive activities inspired by books, students embark on exciting real-life adventures, forging a profound connection with literature and igniting a lifelong love for reading.

***DEAR BVPS***

DEAR BVPS or Drop Everything and Read is a pre-assembly activity done every morning before the start of morning assembly where students will read their English or Mother Tongue storybooks while waiting for school to start at 7.30 a.m. DEAR empowers students with daily moments of immersive reading which not only enhances literacy skills, expands vocabulary, and nurtures imagination, but also cultivates a lifelong love for reading, improves focus, and provides a valuable escape into different worlds.

**Recess Storytelling Time**

Every term, our P4 to P6 English Monitors take turns to conduct storytelling sessions during recess to bring the stories to life for their schoolmates. The sessions give them a chance to express themselves creatively and confidently and allow their friends to experience an exciting life through the world of books. Apart from the student storytellers, our School Leaders and teachers also take on active roles as our Mystery Storytellers which never fail to leave our students in awe and excited to read the book!

##### **Writing @ BVPS**

In Bukit View, we provide students with interesting, shared experiences that will provide them with the content to engage in rich discussions before embarking on the writing process. These experiences serve as a practical context for students to apply acquired language skills to effectively use vocabulary, structure, and style to convey their thoughts in writing.

**Budding Writers Project**

To encourage our young writers to keep their writing passion burning, we compile exemplary pieces of writing to give our students the opportunity to analyse and deconstruct well-crafted pieces of work. By gaining insights into effective writing techniques of their peers, such as structure, tone, and language use, our students are able to expand their writing repertoire as they evaluate and adapt these techniques to their own writing, producing higher-quality compositions they are proud of.

##### **Talent Development in English @ BVPS**


***BV ACEs***

Our Bukit View Accomplished Communicators of English (BV ACEs) Programme aims to develop in students the proficiency to generate, analyse, organise, and express ideas coherently, creatively and critically with discernment. Our selected P4 and P5 students will acquire skills and techniques that will enable them to produce a variety of texts for different purposes, audiences, contexts and cultures, and develop positive dispositions which will enable them to engage effectively and confidently when communicating and collaborating with others.

**Competitions Platforms in English**

Competitions offer a dynamic platform to hone students' language skills as the competitive setting sharpens their critical thinking and encourages them to refine their grammar, vocabulary, and articulation which nurtures growth in the students’ English language proficiency. Thus, here at Bukit View, we provide students with the opportunity to hone their skills and unleash their creativity through various competition platforms for the different language skills.
