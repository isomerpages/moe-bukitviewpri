<h4><strong>Curriculum Framework</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</h4><p>The English Language Syllabus 2020 for the Primary level focuses on the development, reinforcement and extension of language skills in the primary years through an enjoyment of the language and the promotion of extensive reading; and leveraging oracy, reading and writing skills to develop knowledge and independent use of the language.</p><p>The diagram below presents the key features of the EL Syllabus 2020.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 70%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/BVPS%20Experience/Curriculum/English%20Department/E1.png"></div><p>The intent of the ELS 2020 is to develop 21st century skills and emerging competencies in our students and nurture them to be empathetic communicators, discerning readers and creative inquirers.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/BVPS%20Experience/Curriculum/English%20Department/3boxes.png"></div><h2><strong>KEY EL Programmes in BVPS</strong></h2><h5><strong>Speaking @ BVPS</strong></h5><p>Oracy lessons are crucial to foster effective communication skills. Through structured activities and discussions, students learn to articulate thoughts, listen actively, and engage in meaningful dialogues. These skills extend beyond classrooms, preparing students for success in diverse real-world scenarios, developing them as empathetic communicators.</p><p><strong><em>ACTION!</em> Drama in the Curriculum</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Drama is incorporated into the EL curriculum to teach oracy in BVPS. Students take on the role of different characters and learn critical inventive thinking skills such as articulating their thoughts clearly, looking at situations from different perspectives and formulating decisions. Additionally, their command of the language and social emotional learning are further enhanced through the use of thinking routines. In our school, we explore various platforms to provide opportunities for our students to hone their drama skills.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:300px" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/BVPS%20Experience/Curriculum/English%20Department/picture3.jpg"></div><p><strong>News and Views</strong></p><p>News and Views is one such platform in which our P5 and P6 classes showcase their talents through live drama and video performances. Through these performances, the classes will also be incorporating the learning of values and skills that will help them to be self-directed learners, confident leaders and caring citizens.

Students can record a video of them in action and the video clip can be easily shared with their teachers, classmates, friends and families. Not only does this help our students to have an interactive learning experience, they get to have fun reading, acting and performing as well.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/BVPS%20Experience/Curriculum/English%20Department/E9.png"></div><h5><strong>Reading @ BVPS</strong></h5><p>In order to instil the love for reading and encourage reading widely, here at Bukit View, we have a range of activities to keep our students engaged. Our reading programme strives to foster a passion for reading by immersing students in captivating literary journeys through diverse text selections which prompts the exploration of worlds and perspectives as a discerning reader. Through interactive activities inspired by books, students embark on exciting real-life adventures, forging a profound connection with literature and igniting a lifelong love for reading.</p><p><strong><em>DEAR BVPS</em></strong></p><p>DEAR BVPS or Drop Everything and Read is a pre-assembly activity done every morning before the start of morning assembly where students will read their English or Mother Tongue storybooks while waiting for school to start at 7.30 a.m. DEAR empowers students with daily moments of immersive reading which not only enhances literacy skills, expands vocabulary, and nurtures imagination, but also cultivates a lifelong love for reading, improves focus, and provides a valuable escape into different worlds.</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:700px" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/BVPS%20Experience/Curriculum/English%20Department/E6.png"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:700px" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/BVPS%20Experience/Curriculum/English%20Department/picture14.jpg"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Read for Books at BVPS</strong></p><p>Read for Books at BVPS is a charity book drive organised by National Library Board (NLB) National Reading Movement, aimed at celebrating and sharing the joy, and gift of reading with the less privileged.

The sessions give them a chance to express themselves creatively and confidently and allow their friends to experience an exciting life through the world of books. Apart from the student storytellers, our School Leaders and teachers also take on active roles as our Mystery Storytellers which never fail to leave our students in awe and excited to read the book!</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/picture16.jpg"></div><p><strong>Morning Reading Programme</strong></p><p>Our Morning Reading programme, conducted from Monday to Thursday mornings from 7.15 a.m. to 7.30 a.m., aims to guide and support a selected group of P1 and P2 students to be confident readers. Our young readers, who are paired with their P4 and P6 tutors, enjoy a variety of fun and interactive activities during the sessions to help build their reading skills and language proficiency.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/BVPS%20Experience/Curriculum/English%20Department/picture9.jpg"></div><p></p><p><strong>Extensive Reading</strong></p><p>To promote extensive reading in English Language (EL), our students subscribe to newspapers that are used by our teachers as additional reading resources during lessons to build on their language skills and general knowledge. Our P3 and P4 students subscribe to the Little Red Dot, while our P5 and P6 students subscribe to What’s Up. By incorporating these publications in class, we hope to not only enhance students’ awareness of current issues, but to also nurture discerning readers who can make informed decisions and engage with the world around them.</p><p></p><h5><strong>Writing @ BVPS</strong></h5><p>In Bukit View, we provide students with interesting, shared experiences that will provide them with the content to engage in rich discussions before embarking on the writing process. These experiences serve as a practical context for students to apply acquired language skills to effectively use vocabulary, structure, and style to convey their thoughts in writing.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/BVPS%20Experience/Curriculum/English%20Department/picture17.jpg"></div><p><strong>Budding Writers Project</strong></p><p>To encourage our young writers to keep their writing passion burning, we compile exemplary pieces of writing to give our students the opportunity to analyse and deconstruct well-crafted pieces of work. By gaining insights into effective writing techniques of their peers, such as structure, tone, and language use, our students are able to expand their writing repertoire as they evaluate and adapt these techniques to their own writing, producing higher-quality compositions they are proud of.</p><h5><strong>Talent Development in English @ BVPS</strong></h5><p><strong><em>BV ACEs</em></strong></p><p>Our Bukit View Accomplished Communicators of English (BV ACEs) Programme aims to develop in students the proficiency to generate, analyse, organise, and express ideas coherently, creatively and critically with discernment.
