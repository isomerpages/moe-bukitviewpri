#### **Curriculum Framework**&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  


  

The English Language Syllabus 2020 for the Primary level focuses on the development, reinforcement and extension of language skills in the primary years through an enjoyment of the language and the promotion of extensive reading; and leveraging oracy, reading and writing skills to develop knowledge and independent use of the language.  
  
The diagram below presents the key features of the EL Syllabus 2020.

#### **KEY EL Programmes in BVPS**  

**Speaking @ BVPS**

Oracy lessons are crucial to foster effective communication skills. Through structured activities and discussions, students learn to articulate thoughts, listen actively, and engage in meaningful dialogues. These skills extend beyond classrooms, preparing students for success in diverse real-world scenarios, developing them as empathetic communicators.

  ***ACTION!* Drama in the Curriculum**&nbsp;

Drama is incorporated into the EL curriculum to teach oracy in BVPS. Students take on the role of different characters and learn critical inventive thinking skills such as articulating their thoughts clearly, looking at situations from different perspectives and formulating decisions. Additionally, their command of the language and social emotional learning are further enhanced through the use of thinking routines.  In our school, we explore various platforms to provide opportunities for our students to hone their drama skills.

#### **News and Views** 
News and Views is one such platform in which our P5 and P6 classes showcase their talents through live drama and video performances. Through these performances, the classes will also be incorporating the learning of values and skills that will help them to be self-directed learners, confident leaders and caring citizens.

**Digital Storytelling**

As part of our ongoing efforts to help our students acquire and develop oral
communication skills; accurate pronunciation, appropriate intonation, read
expressively and speak with confidence, our P1 to P3 students use a novel digital story book platform, Moo-O, that allows them to be the characters of the story they are reading. Students can record a video of them in action and the video clip can be easily shared with their teachers, classmates, friends and families. Not only does this help our students to have an interactive learning experience, they get to have fun reading, acting and performing as well.

**Reading @ BVPS** 


In order to instil the love for reading and encourage reading widely, here at Bukit View, we have a range of activities to keep our students engaged. Our reading programme strives to foster a passion for reading by immersing students in captivating literary journeys through diverse text selections which prompts the exploration of worlds and perspectives as a discerning reader. Through interactive activities inspired by books, students embark on exciting real-life adventures, forging a profound connection with literature and igniting a lifelong love for reading.

***DEAR BVPS***

DEAR BVPS or Drop Everything and Read is a pre-assembly activity done every morning before the start of morning assembly where students will read their English or Mother Tongue storybooks while waiting for school to start at 7.30 a.m. DEAR empowers students with daily moments of immersive reading which not only enhances literacy skills, expands vocabulary, and nurtures imagination, but also cultivates a lifelong love for reading, improves focus, and provides a valuable escape into different worlds.
