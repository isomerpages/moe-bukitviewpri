#### **Curriculum Framework**&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  


  

The English Language Syllabus 2020 for the Primary level focuses on the development, reinforcement and extension of language skills in the primary years through an enjoyment of the language and the promotion of extensive reading; and leveraging oracy, reading and writing skills to develop knowledge and independent use of the language.  
  
The diagram below presents the key features of the EL Syllabus 2020.

The intent of the ELS 2020 is to develop 21st century skills and emerging competencies in our students and nurture them to be empathetic communicators, discerning readers and creative inquirers.

#### **Key EL Programmes in BVPS**  

  **ACTION! Drama in the Curriculum**&nbsp;

Drama is incorporated into the EL curriculum to teach oracy in BVPS. Students take on the role of different characters and learn critical inventive thinking skills such as articulating their thoughts clearly, looking at situations from different perspectives and formulating decisions. Additionally, their command of the language and social emotional learning are further enhanced through the use of thinking routines.  
  
For P1 and P2 students, the school uses talk moves in the drama lessons to develop empathetic communicators and creative inquirers.

For P5 and P6 students, drama provides a platform for students to hone their skills and showcase their talents as they collaborate with their peers to put up drama performances for the whole school.

**Words-Go-Round**&nbsp;**Author’s Talk**&nbsp;

  

Words-Go-Round Author’s Talk is an outreach programme of the Singapore Writers Festival organised by the National Arts Council. For P3 and P4 students, they got to learn about the sheer variety of dinosaurs that lived in the Age of Reptiles with Andy Chua, the author of the Fossil Finders series. They also learnt how to include scientific facts in their stories and get to see Chua’s fossil collection up close. &nbsp;&nbsp;

  

**NLB Books-To-Go**

**DEAR BVPS**  

  

DEAR means Drop Everything and Read. It is a pre-assembly activity done every morning before the start of morning assembly where students will read their English or Mother Tongue storybooks while waiting for school to start at 7.30 a.m. The English monitors of each class will be going around to encourage their classmates to read.

**Library Activities**&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  

  

**Monthly Thematic Activities**&nbsp;

  

Each month, students get to explore different book genres and the activities associated with the theme on Student Learning Space (SLS) and their Reading Fun Journals. Some of the themes include ‘Fantasy Fun’, ‘Mystery is in the Air’, ‘Books to Movies’ and ‘Celebrating Friendships’.&nbsp;

  

**Mystery Storyteller**&nbsp;

  

Each term, a mystery storyteller is invited to share a part of a storybook from the school library, to invoke the interest of reading in students. We invited one of our beloved teachers, Mr Dzuhri, to take on the role of Gargamel from The Smurf Apprentice and act out a small part of the story as a recess activity. The children had a hearty laugh and were eager to find out the end of the story by borrowing the storybook.

#### **ICT in English**  

  

**Moo-O**&nbsp;

  

Moo-O is a participatory electronic story book which provides a fun and engaging software programme that encourages children to read expressively and develop their storytelling skills. &nbsp; Using a webcam, the children will be transported into the virtual story world, where they become the characters they have chosen. Then using a PC microphone, the children can record their voices as they read the story. The final video clip they produce can be easily shared with teachers, classmates, friends and families. &nbsp;&nbsp;

  

**NewsMaker**&nbsp;

  

NewsMaker provides students an easy, affordable and fun platform to practise writing, speaking and presentation skills with the help of interactive digital media. &nbsp; With NewsMaker, students take on the role of news anchor and producer, creating their own story in 3 easy steps: Write! Read! Publish!
