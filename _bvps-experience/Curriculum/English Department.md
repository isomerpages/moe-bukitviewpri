#### **Curriculum Framework**&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  


  

The English Language Syllabus 2020 for the Primary level focuses on the development, reinforcement and extension of language skills in the primary years through an enjoyment of the language and the promotion of extensive reading; and leveraging oracy, reading and writing skills to develop knowledge and independent use of the language.  
  
The diagram below presents the key features of the EL Syllabus 2020.

The intent of the ELS 2020 is to develop 21st century skills and emerging competencies in our students and nurture them to be empathetic communicators, discerning readers and creative inquirers.

#### **Key EL Programmes in BVPS**  

**Speaking @ BVPS**

Oracy lessons are crucial to foster effective communication skills. Through structured activities and discussions, students learn to articulate thoughts, listen actively, and engage in meaningful dialogues. These skills extend beyond classrooms, preparing students for success in diverse real-world scenarios, developing them as empathetic communicators.

  **ACTION! Drama in the Curriculum**&nbsp;

Drama is incorporated into the EL curriculum to teach oracy in BVPS. Students take on the role of different characters and learn critical inventive thinking skills such as articulating their thoughts clearly, looking at situations from different perspectives and formulating decisions. Additionally, their command of the language and social emotional learning are further enhanced through the use of thinking routines.  In our school, we explore various platforms to provide opportunities for our students to hone their drama skills.

#### **Extensive Reading Programmes**&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  

  

**Words-Go-Round**&nbsp;**Author’s Talk**&nbsp;

  

Words-Go-Round Author’s Talk is an outreach programme of the Singapore Writers Festival organised by the National Arts Council. For P3 and P4 students, they got to learn about the sheer variety of dinosaurs that lived in the Age of Reptiles with Andy Chua, the author of the Fossil Finders series. They also learnt how to include scientific facts in their stories and get to see Chua’s fossil collection up close. &nbsp;&nbsp;

  

**NLB Books-To-Go**

**Read for Books at BVPS**&nbsp;  

  

Read for Books at BVPS is a charity book drive organised by National Library Board (NLB) National Reading Movement, aimed at celebrating and sharing the joy, and gift of reading with the less privileged. Our BVPS family has been a part of this worthy cause since 2017.

**DEAR BVPS**  

  

DEAR means Drop Everything and Read. It is a pre-assembly activity done every morning before the start of morning assembly where students will read their English or Mother Tongue storybooks while waiting for school to start at 7.30 a.m. The English monitors of each class will be going around to encourage their classmates to read.

**Library Activities**&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  

  

**Monthly Thematic Activities**&nbsp;

  

Each month, students get to explore different book genres and the activities associated with the theme on Student Learning Space (SLS) and their Reading Fun Journals. Some of the themes include ‘Fantasy Fun’, ‘Mystery is in the Air’, ‘Books to Movies’ and ‘Celebrating Friendships’.&nbsp;

  

**Mystery Storyteller**&nbsp;

  

Each term, a mystery storyteller is invited to share a part of a storybook from the school library, to invoke the interest of reading in students. We invited one of our beloved teachers, Mr Dzuhri, to take on the role of Gargamel from The Smurf Apprentice and act out a small part of the story as a recess activity. The children had a hearty laugh and were eager to find out the end of the story by borrowing the storybook.

#### **ICT in English**  

  

**Moo-O**&nbsp;

  

Moo-O is a participatory electronic story book which provides a fun and engaging software programme that encourages children to read expressively and develop their storytelling skills. &nbsp; Using a webcam, the children will be transported into the virtual story world, where they become the characters they have chosen. Then using a PC microphone, the children can record their voices as they read the story. The final video clip they produce can be easily shared with teachers, classmates, friends and families. &nbsp;&nbsp;

  

**NewsMaker**&nbsp;

  

NewsMaker provides students an easy, affordable and fun platform to practise writing, speaking and presentation skills with the help of interactive digital media. &nbsp; With NewsMaker, students take on the role of news anchor and producer, creating their own story in 3 easy steps: Write! Read! Publish!
