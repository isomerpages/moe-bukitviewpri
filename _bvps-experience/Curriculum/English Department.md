#### **Curriculum Framework**&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  


  

The English Language Syllabus 2020 for the Primary level focuses on the development, reinforcement and extension of language skills in the primary years through an enjoyment of the language and the promotion of extensive reading; and leveraging oracy, reading and writing skills to develop knowledge and independent use of the language.  
  
The diagram below presents the key features of the EL Syllabus 2020.

#### **KEY EL Programmes in BVPS**  

**Speaking @ BVPS**

Oracy lessons are crucial to foster effective communication skills. Through structured activities and discussions, students learn to articulate thoughts, listen actively, and engage in meaningful dialogues. These skills extend beyond classrooms, preparing students for success in diverse real-world scenarios, developing them as empathetic communicators.

  ***ACTION!* Drama in the Curriculum**&nbsp;

Drama is incorporated into the EL curriculum to teach oracy in BVPS. Students take on the role of different characters and learn critical inventive thinking skills such as articulating their thoughts clearly, looking at situations from different perspectives and formulating decisions. Additionally, their command of the language and social emotional learning are further enhanced through the use of thinking routines.  In our school, we explore various platforms to provide opportunities for our students to hone their drama skills.

#### **News and Views** 
News and Views is one such platform in which our P5 and P6 classes showcase their talents through live drama and video performances. Through these performances, the classes will also be incorporating the learning of values and skills that will help them to be self-directed learners, confident leaders and caring citizens.
