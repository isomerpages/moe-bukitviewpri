<p>At Bukit View Primary School, we believe that children learn best in caring
and safe environments. Our students are actively involved in the construction
of knowledge and developing thinking skills as well as dispositions with
the help of assessments that address their learning gaps.</p>
<p>We curate hands-on learning experiences that inspire curiosity and foster
a love for science. From SPARKLE kits and lab activities to outdoor explorations
and digital platforms like the Student Learning Space (SLS), our programs
are designed to cultivate young inquirers ready to tackle the questions
of tomorrow.</p>

<p><strong>Science Remedials</strong> 
<br>We provide after-school remedial program to offer targeted support to
selected students, addressing individual learning needs in a nurturing,
small-group setting.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Science Talent Development Programme</strong> 
<br>For students with a strong foundation in science, we offer specialized
programs like the Excellence 2000 (E2K) Science Enrichment and the Science
Olympiad, aimed at honing independent scientific inquiry, developing science
process skills, and advanced science investigations that cover challenging
scientific concepts.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Engagement Beyond the Classroom</strong> 
<br>We provide opportunities to our students to showcase their abilities and
nurture their talents. To this end, we actively look for external competitions
organized by the Singapore Science Centre or other relevant organizations.
We also provide support and follow up with the students to ensure their
participation in these events. Some examples of such events include "STEM
Playground," "Science Buskers," and "Abbott Learning Day," which are organized
by the Singapore Science Centre, and the “Nobel Winter Workshop” organized
by NUS High.

<p><strong>Inspiring Young Minds</strong>
</p>
<p>To encourage the learning of Science among Primary 3 students, we provide
them with a subscription to The Young Scientists magazine. It is a monthly
publication designed to help students better understand the Science concepts
and content that are part of the Lower Block themes in the latest Primary
Science syllabus.</p>
