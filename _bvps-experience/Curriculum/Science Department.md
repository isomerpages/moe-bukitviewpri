**ICT in Science**  

Information Technology (IT) plays an important role in learning. It encourages students to be self-directed and collaborative learners - taking responsibility for their own learning and empowering them in the learning process.  
  
In Science, ICT tools such as Nearpods, Google docs, dataloggers and iPad applications are used to deepen understanding and give students an opportunity to interact and learn from their web sources through research, in the process, questioning the reliability of Science facts found in the World Wide Web.  
  
  
**Environmental Education Programme (EEP)**  

EEP aims to raise awareness about the importance of caring for the environment. Part of learning Science is to learn about the environment and how our actions affect the environment. Thus, to create such awareness, we celebrate Earth and Water Week to raise awareness about climate change, energy, food and water wastage, and conservation of wildlife and sea creatures. Students are also involved in a recycling programme, Green for Hope, a fortnightly collection of newspapers and plastic bottles.
