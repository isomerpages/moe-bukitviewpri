<p>At Bukit View Primary School, we believe that children learn best in caring
and safe environments. Our students are actively involved in the construction
of knowledge and developing thinking skills as well as dispositions with
the help of assessments that address their learning gaps.</p>
<p>We curate hands-on learning experiences that inspire curiosity and foster
a love for science. From SPARKLE kits and lab activities to outdoor explorations
and digital platforms like the Student Learning Space (SLS), our programs
are designed to cultivate young inquirers ready to tackle the questions
of tomorrow.</p>
