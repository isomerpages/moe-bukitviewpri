<p>At Bukit View Primary School, we believe that children learn best in caring
and safe environments. Our students are actively involved in the construction
of knowledge and developing thinking skills as well as dispositions with
the help of assessments that address their learning gaps.</p>
<p>We curate hands-on learning experiences that inspire curiosity and foster
a love for science. From SPARKLE kits and lab activities to outdoor explorations
and digital platforms like the Student Learning Space (SLS), our programs
are designed to cultivate young inquirers ready to tackle the questions
of tomorrow.</p>

<h3>KEY PROGRAMMES</h3>
<h4><strong>Science Garden Trail</strong></h4>
<p>Our school has a variety of thematic gardens located in different green
spaces on our campus. These gardens are categorized into 'Herbs &amp; Spices',
'Cacti &amp; Succulents', 'Ferns', and 'Fragrant' gardens. We encourage
our students to explore and be curious about the plants and animals around
them, as this helps them appreciate our environment's biodiversity. By
identifying and recognizing different groups of living things based on
their similarities and differences, students can gain a deeper understanding
and appreciation of the diversity within our school and the world around
us.</p>
