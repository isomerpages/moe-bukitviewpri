##### **Visual Arts** 



  

Bukit View Primary School's Aesthetics Programme develop in students a range of Arts skills - from playing various musical instruments, like the recorder, ukulele and keyboard, to learning to dance in different dance genres, to creating artworks using ceramics and other media for visual arts. This array of experiences provides students a journey of self-discovery of their strengths and interests in the Arts whilst developing resilience and confidence amidst striving for excellence. 

Global awareness and cross cultural skills for the 21st century are also developed when students learn about various ethnic cultures and traditions, hence fostering students’ sense of identity, culture and place in the society.

Beyond lessons in the art, music and dance classroom lessons, the school extends many opportunities for students to deepen and apply their learning and skills through school events, Co-Curricular Activities (CCA), external showcases and competitions. All these contribute to the aesthetics culture in the school which is recognised as the Centre of Excellence for Aesthetics in the West Zone.
