#### **Key Programmes** 



**Mother Tongue Extensive Reading Programme** 

Extensive Reading Programme for P1 to P6 provides a platform for our pupils to read Mother Tongue Language books and reading materials widely so as to enable pupils to widen their vocabulary. Accompanying materials are also used to enrich pupils' learning and imagination. Pupils will also get to do reviews and be given opportunities to re-create what they have read with guidance from teachers.

**10’CMT**    

First introduced in 2008 by MOE’s Educational Technological Division (ETD), 10’CMT is a teaching and learning approach that harnesses ICT to promote students’ interest in the Mother Tongue Languages and improve language competencies. It adopts a learner-centred approach which is well balanced with teachers’ guidance and facilitation during curriculum time. In Bukit View, 10’CMT provides ample opportunities for the students to consolidate and expand their learning through the use of networked computers. We hope that 10’CMT will improve the students’ language skills and also develop them to be self-directed and collaborative learners in a communicative and interactive environment.

**Mother Tongue Fortnight** 

This is the sixth consecutive year that the MT Department organises the Mother Tongue Fortnight for our students in Bukit View Primary School. The Mother Tongue Fortnight, an MOE initiative since 2011, serves as an apt reminder that it is essential for our pupils to stay rooted in their own respective cultures, while embracing Singapore as a multicultural and multilingual society.   The MT Department will be organizing a two-week programme in Term 1 comprising a range of interesting and engaging activities in authentic situations for our students during the MTL Fortnight. These hands-on tasks will be a good platform to promote the cultural richness found in each respective language.

**Festive Celebrations** 

Every year in Bukit View Primary School, we celebrate Chinese New Year, Hari Raya and Deepavali together as part of our National Education. It allows the students to have a better understanding of other races and cultures in Singapore and appreciate the multi-racial and multi-cultural society in Singapore.
