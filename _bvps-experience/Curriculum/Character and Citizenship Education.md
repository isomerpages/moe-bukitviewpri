<p>In Bukit View Primary School, we hope to nurture Bukit Viewans to be <strong>Caring Citizens of Good Character</strong>.</p>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), including National Education
(NE) and Social and Emotional Learning (SEL), is integral to the holistic
development of our students, leading to positive life outcomes. CCE 2021
provides an integrated approach to addressing our students’ development
of values, character, social-emotional well-being and citizenship dispositions
in a coherent and holistic way.</p>
<p>The curriculum content of CCE is premised on the three big ideas of Identity,
Relationships and Choices. It is anchored on the teaching of core values,
social-emotional competencies and citizenship dispositions to develop in
our students’ good character, resilience and social-emotional well-being,
future readiness and active citizenship.</p>

<p><strong>Key CCE Programmes in BVPS</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>CCE lessons (CCE FTGP, CCE (MTL) and PAL)</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>CCE FTGP</strong> 
<br>CCE FTGP lessons are conducted by all Form Teachers. We emphasise on the
explicit teaching of social-emotional competencies in CCE FTGP. This lays
the foundation for more complex conversations and discussions. Topics related
to developing citizenship dispositions are also taught in CCE FTGP to foster
inter-ethnic understanding and appreciation for one another’s culture in
a multicultural classroom setting.</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>CCE (MTL) Lessons</strong>
</p>
<p>CCE (MTL) lessons share common unit titles with variations in the lesson
titles based on the cultural stories, practices, proverbs or songs selected
by each language. The vocabulary learnt by the students during their MTL
lessons at each level provides a guide in the choice of proverbs and the
activities in the CCE (MTL) Student Journals. The questions and activities
are designed to help students relate to the stories, songs, and cultural
practices that are set in a different context and apply the learning to
their current realities. Lessons are also designed to provide students
with more opportunities to discuss and internalise the values.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Programme for Active Learning (PAL<u>)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>PAL is an integral part of the curriculum for all Primary 1 and 2 students.
The programme offers hands-on and experiential learning through the following
four domains: Sports &amp; Games, Outdoor Education, Visual Arts, and Performing
Arts. PAL provides opportunities for students to discover new interests,
develop character and enables them to develop social-emotional competencies.
The five characteristics of PAL are as follow:</p>
<p>1. Focus on Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) and values;</p>
<p>2. Be driven by experiential learning;</p>
<p>3. Encompass learning in creative ways;</p>
<p>4. Provide opportunities to create; and</p>
<p>5. Engage in fun and enjoyable learning.</p>

<p><strong><u>Positive Behaviour Support System (PBSS)</u></strong> 
<br>PBSS aims to provide a structured way to promote positive relationships
among students in school. This programme complements CCE(FTGP) lessons
as we explore different strategies and structures to develop our students’
social-emotional competencies. As part of PBSS, we also guide our Bukit
Viewans to set SMART goals every semester and to reflect and ACT (<strong>A</strong>ims
&amp; <strong>A</strong>spirations, <strong>C</strong>urrently at present, <strong>T</strong>ry
it Out) in alignment with our school values of GR2IT.</p>

<p>
<br><strong><u>Values In Action(VIA)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>VIA is a learning experience in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)
that enhances students’ development as socially responsible citizens through
ownership of their contribution to the community.</p>
<p>Students are given an opportunity to choose and have a voice in what they
believe will make a difference in the community. Being actively involved
in learning about and appreciating the community develops their sense of
commitment in playing their part to make it a better place.</p>
<p>As part of our school’s VIA programme, our school showcases the P1-P6
VIA projects through our VIA Learning Day. Through the VIA projects, our
students have learned and applied important values and skills. Additionally,
they have demonstrated active citizenship and worked towards our school’s
vision of being Caring Citizens as they learnt to serve in their family,
school and community.</p>
<p>Showcase of Primary 1 and Primary 2 VIA projects “I Love My Family” and
“I Love My School”:</p>

<p>Our Primary 3 students embarked on their VIA project “I am a Good Neighbour”.
Collaborating with St Luke’s Hospital, our students gained interesting
insights into the lives of the elderly. This meaningful project was a thoughtful
lesson on empathy and in the power of small gestures to make a big difference.
Our students learnt the true essence of being good neighbours – giving
back to the community in their own special ways. Together, they created
an array of heartwarming videos, games, crafts, ornaments and activities
designed to bring joy and companionship to our elderly neighbours. You
can admire the fruits of their labour and love here:</p>

<p>Our Primary 4 students learnt to champion a gracious and responsible heartland
living and contribute to building a safe and caring community through their
involvement in the
<br>“I am a Responsible Heartlander” Project.</p>

<p>Our Primary 5 students designed several interesting activities during
their VIA Project, ‘Buddy Works’. They engaged the K2 students who visited
BVPS in these activities.

<p>Our Primary 6 students learnt to show care to others in the community
and spread the message of reducing wastage to protect the environment through
their VIA Project, ‘BVPS Heartbeat’. They creatively repurposed materials
around them into amazing craftworks such as bookmarks, keychains, stickers,
multi-purpose holders and decorative items which they sold to their schoolmates.
The proceeds of the sales went to the Straits Times School Pocket Money
Fund.</p>

<p><strong><u>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Experiences</u></strong>
</p>
<p>With the revised Primary School Leaving Examinations (PSLE) scoring system
and diversity of secondary education pathways, students need to be guided
to make informed school choices while considering their values, strengths,
interests and skills. ECG experiences in BVPS (e.g. secondary school talks,
career talks) are opportunities to build students’ self-awareness and knowledge
of the different education and career pathways. Such experiences would
be especially valuable for students in their primary school years, which
are a time for growth and discovery.</p>

<p><strong><u>National Education (NE) Commemorative Days</u></strong>
</p>
<p>BVPS commemorates four NE Commemorative Days every year. These provide
opportunities for students to deepen their appreciation of our shared past
and Singapore’s current realities. Besides school-wide commemoration, CCE
(FTGP) lessons related to NE Commemorative Days are conducted with the
use of contemporary content through Kindsville Times/A-Ok.</p>

<p><strong><u>Cohort Learning Journeys (LJs)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>All students will experience at least one Cohort LJ per year from Primary
4. Cohort LJs have been developed to provide students with opportunities
to explore their Singaporean identity through the arts, culture and heritage.
These complement the Art, Character and Citizenship Education, Social Studies
(SS) and History (HY) curricula.</p>
